In this task, we embarked on a journey to build an image classification model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The goal was to distinguish between images of cats and dogs. The task was carried out in  R.

We started by preparing the dataset, which consisted of images of cats and dogs. The images were stored in a zip file, which was extracted to create a directory of images. The images were then loaded and preprocessed for training the model.

Next, we defined the architecture of the CNN model. The model consisted of several convolutional and max pooling layers for feature extraction, followed by dense layers for classification. We compiled the model with the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer.

After compiling the model, we trained it using the prepared dataset. The training process involved feeding the images to the model and adjusting the model’s weights based on its performance. We monitored the model’s loss and accuracy during training to check its progress.

Finally, we used the trained model to make predictions on new images. We loaded and preprocessed the new images in the same way as the training images, and then fed them to the model. The model outputted a prediction for each image, indicating whether it thought the image was of a cat or a dog.
